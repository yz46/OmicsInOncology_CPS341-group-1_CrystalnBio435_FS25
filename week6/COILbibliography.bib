  abstract  = "The myeloma surface proteome (surfaceome) determines tumor
               interaction with the microenvironment and serves as an emerging
               arena for therapeutic development. Here, we use glycoprotein
               capture proteomics to define the myeloma surfaceome at baseline,
               in drug resistance, and in response to acute drug treatment. We
               provide a scoring system for surface antigens and identify CCR10
               as a promising target in this disease expressed widely on
               malignant plasma cells. We engineer proof-of-principle chimeric
               antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CCR10 using its natural
               ligand CCL27. In myeloma models we identify proteins that could
               serve as markers of resistance to bortezomib and lenalidomide,
               including CD53, CD10, EVI2B, and CD33. We find that acute
               lenalidomide treatment increases activity of MUC1-targeting
               CAR-T cells through antigen upregulation. Finally, we develop a
               miniaturized surface proteomic protocol for profiling primary
               plasma cell samples with low inputs. These approaches and
               datasets may contribute to the biological, therapeutic, and
               diagnostic understanding of myeloma.",
