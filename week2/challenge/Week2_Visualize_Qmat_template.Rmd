# Visualize Quantitative Matrix

We are using `r fN` here to visualize these values as a heatmap.\
*Maybe describe here what you are doing to the values before plotting them*\
*Try also to use references (you may need to expand the bibliography file) and use figure including captions*\

*RStudio has also linked Cheatsheets for Rmarkdown in the Help section*

```{r print data, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
print("In print statements you can also describe things directly in the R junks, but usually this is not the best way to do it.")
print(fN)
```

Here we try to have a minimal plot with some caption.
```{r minimalPlot, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.cap="(ref:minimalPlot)", echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
plot(1,1, main="A minimal plot with a title")
```
(ref:minimalPlot) This plot here is a minimal plot with a caption. It is not very informative, but it is a start.
