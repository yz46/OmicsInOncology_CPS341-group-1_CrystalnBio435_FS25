# Introduction

The data that we are going to use for this exercise is published in the mBio paper [@niggli2023mbio]. 
It can be found online on: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23578086.v1
It describes the OD600 (growth) of the *Staphylococcus aureus* strain **JE2** in different media.

# Reading in Data and Plotting Growth Curves

```{r load data, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
fN <- "JE_growth_final.txt"
data <- read_tsv(fN)
```

```{r aggreg, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# aggregate with mean and sd
aggregated_data2 <- data %>%
  group_by(Time, Growth_Medium) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_OD600 = mean(OD600_blank_corrected, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_OD600 = sd(OD600_blank_corrected, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```


```{r ggplotGrowth, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.cap="(ref:ggplotGrowth)", eval=TRUE}

ggplot(aggregated_data2, aes(x = Time, y = mean_OD600, group = Growth_Medium, color = Growth_Medium)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_OD600 - sd_OD600, ymax = mean_OD600 + sd_OD600), width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Aggregated Growth Curve", x = "Time (h)", y = "Mean OD600 (Blank Corrected)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red", "green"))
```
(ref:ggplotGrowth) Shown are the OD600 growth averaged over multiple experiments and replicates in different media conditions.

Now looking for a test that shows that these curves are significantly different would be an overkill here ;). The picture is very clear. The SN condition grows definitely worse than the two others.
