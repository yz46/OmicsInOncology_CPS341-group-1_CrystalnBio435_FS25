# Introduction

The data that we are going to use for this exercise is published in the mBio paper [@niggli2023mbio]. 
It can be found online on: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23578086.v1
It describes the OD600 (growth) of the *Staphylococcus aureus* strain **JE2** in different media.

# Reading in Data and Plotting Growth Curves

```{r load data, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
fN <- "JE_growth_final.txt" # us this txt file that is copy pasted spread sheet from excel tab separated 
dat <- read.table(fN, header = T, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

```{r print data, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# this print command is only shown on the html if include = TRUE
print("these are so called junks of code, you may include them to be shown in the rendered document (html here) each junk has a unique name next to it and then some additional arguments")
print(fN)
```

```{r dimensions, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# 
dd <- dim(dat)
```

The dimensions of this dataset are shown above.
It is easy possible to show also content of variables in the html part.  
Note: if you end a line with 2 spaces you go to a new paragraph.  
  
Like here: `r dd`


# Session Information

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create scatter plot with trend line, color-coded by Growth Medium
dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = OD600_blank_corrected, color = Experiment)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Growth_Medium) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +  # Scatter points with some transparency
  labs(title = "Bacterial Growth Curve", x = "Time (hours)", y = "OD600 (Corrected)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
