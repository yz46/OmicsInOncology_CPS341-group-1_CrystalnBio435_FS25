This is the official gh repos for the COIL course of UU n UZH

## Course Description
The course will give an introduction into multiple Omics technologies (no wet-lab), including bioinformatics, and the basic concepts of oncology.You will learn not only the technological aspects of the different omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, & metabolomics).
Through lectures, work sessions, literature discussions, hands-on data analysis in R, and guest lectures from active researchers in the field, you will learn how different omics technologies work and how they are being used to solve those biological questions in oncology.
