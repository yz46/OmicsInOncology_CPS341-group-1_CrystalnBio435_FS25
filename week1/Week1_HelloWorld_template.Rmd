```{r load libraries, include=FALSE}
# run this line (uncomment) to install readr from CRAN:
# install.packages("readr")

# make sure your R has this library loaded, if not install it (see lines above).
# Also, RStudio will offer to install it for you if it finds you try to load it if you haven't installed it yet.

library(readr) 
```
# Running R code in RMarkdown!

The major strength of RMarkdown is, that you can write code, and the result is going to be shown in the document:

```{r code}
1+2
1:5
```

# Play around with RMarkdown

Try to play around with Rmarkdown. You can find a cheatsheet in RStudio under Help. 

![This is a screenshot showing where you find the Rmd cheatsheets](../img/CheatsheetsInRStudio.png){width=350px}
*RStudio has also linked Cheatsheets for Rmarkdown in the Help section*

You may include any other picture or do any other thing you like.
